    "## Sequential pattern mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential pattern mining consists of discovering interesting subsequences in a set of sequences (where, has a comparison, mining frequent itemsets consisted in discovering itemsets in a set of transaction). In the context of our example, sequential pattern mining can be used to find the sequences of items frequently bought by customers, as we acknowledged that transaction data could have be ordered by time, with the proper table joins (`orders.csv`). This can be useful to understand the behavior of customers to take marketing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a transformation is however pretty heavy, and an already transformed dataset, `output/transactions_seq.txt` is already provided with this notebook; a 4-columns csv-like file (separators are tabulation characters) as such:\n",
    "- Column 1: user id;\n",
    "- Column 2: order number (not an order id, but a number in the sequence of orders);\n",
    "- Column 3: size of order;\n",
    "- Column 4: list of products in text format (without spaces), separated by a comma;\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to mine sequential pattern from our data, we will use the CloSpan Algorithm, from the SPMF library. This algorithm is used for discovering **closed** sequential patterns in sequence databases. As a closed frequent itemset is to a frequent itemset; a closed sequential pattern is a sequential pattern such that it is not strictly included in another pattern having the same support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data formatting \n",
    "\n",
    "The input file format for SPMF CloSpan is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each line represents a sequence from a sequence database, and ends with the value -2;\n",
    "- Each item from a sequence is a positive integer, and items from the same itemset within a sequence are order ascendingly, and separated by single space;\n",
    "- Each itemset is separated by the value -1;\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of input from the SPMF Documentation :\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 -1 1 2 3 -1 1 3 -1 4 -1 3 6 -1 -2\n",
    "1 4 -1 3 -1 2 3 -1 1 5 -1 -2\n",
    "5 6 -1 1 2 -1 4 6 -1 3 -1 2 -1 -2\n",
    "5 -1 7 -1 1 6 -1 3 -1 2 -1 3 -1 -2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to our example, the file `transactions_sec.txt` has yet be found quite unusable, as the 'comma' has been used as a separator to separate items within the itemsets, making it impossible to map the `product_names` to their actual id.\n",
    "\n",
    "`96980\t15\t10 Asparagus,GreekExtraVirginOliveOil,Jelly,Blackberry,OrganicButterhead(Boston,Butter,Bibb)Lettuce,OrganicIcebergLettuce,RiceWhip,RipeLargePittedOlives`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exemple above, `Jelly,Blackberry` and `OrganicButterhead(Boston,Butter,Bibb)Lettuce` are two separate products. Thus total count of products is 8, not 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only way to compute this file has been to map all unique `strings` to a new integer (in a certain way, to compute our own `products.csv` (re-joining both `orders` and `order_product` is not an easy process).  It's a bit sad though as we won't be able to compute more stats on aisles or departments from our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here will be the transformations to apply : \n",
    "- Group each order per `client_id`: This will be our sequences;\n",
    "- Map the product to an integer;\n",
    "- Order and format the sequence as specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm below executes this exact process, for you to tinker with. Two files have been generated and available for you though. \n",
    "- `products_transactions_seq.csv`, a map of products to their 'new' unique id;\n",
    "- `formatted_transactions_seq.txt`, the formatted `transactions_sec.txt` as intended.\n",
